# Guides: Version Control

Last minor updates were in August 2021 for Fall 2021 classes. Here are some useful tips for this class and other classes as well. 

For *CAT327 - Game Programming Studio* and *CAT328 - Artificial Intelligence for Games*, all programming assignments will be submitted to GitHub, so here's some help to start using Git.

## Install a client

A Git client is a program designed to get and send files to a repository. There are different flavors to suite your tastes:

### Application clients

One of the easiest solutions is to install 

* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

There are also other clients like:

* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - Free
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - Free *(with GitHub Student pack!)*

You may also try [GitHub for Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/version-control/github-for-unity-118069), but your mileage might vary. Mac use

### Desktop Explorer/Finder clients

If you like working in right in your Windows Explorer or Finder, there are tools that allow you to right-click and do things with Git!

For Windows:

* [TortoiseGit](Installing-TortoiseGIT/README.md) - Free

For Mac:

  * [SnailGit Lite: Git for Finder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snailgit-free-git-client-finder/id1099475282?mt=12) - Free - Limited to only 1 repo 
  * [SnailGit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snailgit/id847260112?l=en&mt=12#) - $9.99 - Unlimited repos

## Use a client 

Once you have something installed, then you can read:

* [How to get a repo from GitHub](Getting-Stuff/README.md) 

If you decide to go with a Tortoise product, then you may want to read:

* [Working with Tortoise](Working-With-Tortoise/README.md)

After you have that initial connection to the GitHub repository then you can read:

* [How to get updates from a GitHub repo](Updating-From-GitHub/README.md)
* [How to submit your changes to a GitHub repo](Sending-Stuff/README.md)

## Client documentation

Here are some links to documentation to the clients that we will support:

#### GitHub Desktop

## Subversion

While you can still use Subversion for GitHub, there's no reason you have to or should. Git has pretty much become the standard for version control. But if you really want...

For Windows:

* [TortoiseSVN](Installing-TortoiseSVN/README.md) - Free
