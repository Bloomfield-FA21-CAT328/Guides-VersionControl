# Guides

Updated for Fall 2016! Here are some useful tips for this class and other classes as well. 

## Version Control

For this class, all assignments are being submitted via GitHub, so you will need to get used to using Git (or even use SVN).

### Install a client

One of the easiest solutions is to install 
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

or if you like working in right in Windows Explorer, use one of these:

* [TortoiseGit](Installing-TortoiseGIT/README.md)
* [TortoiseSVN](Installing-TortoiseSVN/README.md)

Now Mac users have a similar product that works in Finder:

* Free - Limitted to only 1 repo 
  * [SnailGit - Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snailgit-free-git-client-finder/id1099475282?mt=12)
  * [SnailSVN - Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snailsvn-free-svn-client-finder/id1063090543?mt=12)

* Paid version - IUnlimitted repos
  * [SnailGit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snailgit/id847260112?l=en&mt=12#) -$6.99
  * [SnailSVN](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snailsvn/id847259925?ls=1&mt=12#) - $8.99

### Using a client 

Once you have something installed, then you can read:
* [How to get a repo from GitHub](Getting-Stuff/README.md) 

If you decide to go with a Tortoise product, then you may want to read:
* [Working with Tortoise](Working-With-Tortoise/README.md)

After you have that inital connection to the GitHub repository then you can read:
* [How to get updates from a GitHub repo](Updating-From-GitHub/README.md)
* [How to submit your changes to a GitHub repo](Sending-Stuff/README.md)

### Client documentation

Here are some links to the clients that we will support:
