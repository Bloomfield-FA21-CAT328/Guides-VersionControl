# Getting Stuff

Once a repo has been made it's time to start working on it! 

## GitHub Desktop 
If you are using Github Desktop, read about [Cloning a repository from GitHub to GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/) from their documentation. You can also click on the *Code* butotn and then selectet *Open with GitHub Desktop*.

If you are using TortoiseGit, you can clone a GitHub repo like this:

* Click on the "Clone or download" button.

* In the Cone with HTTPS popup, click on the little clipboard icon to copy the web url. Or copy the textfield

* If the repo is private, TortoiseGit may ask for a username and password

* Depending on the size of the repo, and your internet connection, you may be watching the progress bar for a while.

* If the repo is private, TortoiseSVN may ask for authentication. Use your GitHub username and password.

* Depending on the size of the repo, and your internet connection, it may take a while to download all the files.

### Important notice for SVN users!
  
Once it's complete, if you open the folder, you will notice that there are two folders *branches* and *trunk*. You will want to work in the *trunk*, since this is the default folder for what is actively developer. If there were any branches of the repo in GitHub, they would end up in the *branches* folder.
So now you can dive into that *trunk* folder and start modifying it. Once you are done and check out how to [send your changes](../Sending-Stuff/README.md)
